- **Runtime**: Capacitor (for Native Mobile access)
- **Styling**: SCSS (Custom Design System)
- **API Integration**: REST API (Laravel Backend)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli): `npm install -g @ionic/cli`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/iot-fire-detection-app.git
    cd iot-fire-detection-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment**
    Copy `src/environments/environment.ts` and ensure your API URL is correct.
    ```typescript
    export const environment = {
      production: false,
      apiUrl: 'https://your-api-endpoint.com/api' // Update this
    };
    ```

4.  **Run Locally (Browser)**
    ```bash
    ionic serve
    ```
    The app will open at `http://localhost:8100`.

## 📱 Building for Mobile (Android)

1.  **Build the Web Assets**
    ```bash
